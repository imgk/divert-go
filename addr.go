// events can be blocked. However, it is not possible to inject new or modified socket events.

// before the handle was opened.

// the corresponding connection is closed (for TCP), or based on an activity timeout (non-TCP).
// Flow-related events can be captured, but not blocked nor injected. Process ID information is
// also available at this layer. Due to technical limitations, the WINDIVERT_LAYER_FLOW layer
// cannot capture flow events that occurred before the handle was opened.

// Reflect is ...
// Finally, the WINDIVERT_LAYER_REFLECT layer can capture events relating to WinDivert itself,

// WinDivert events can be captured but not injected nor blocked. Process ID information
// (of the process responsible for opening the WinDivert handle) is available at this layer.
// This layer also returns data in the form of an "object" representation of the filter string
// used to open the handle. The object representation can be converted back into a human-readable
// filter string using the WinDivertHelperFormatFilter() function. This layer can also capture
// events that occurred before the handle was opened. This layer cannot capture events related
// to other WINDIVERT_LAYER_REFLECT-layer handles.
